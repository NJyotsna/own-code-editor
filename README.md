About the Project

When I was in my first year of B.Tech, I struggled to figure out how and where to run HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I didn’t know how to link files properly. At that time, I was only familiar with Java and Python, so web development felt confusing.

I built this Own Code Editor to make learning and experimenting with web development simpler and more interactive. It allows you to write, run, and test HTML, CSS, and JavaScript directly in the browser, so beginners can focus on understanding concepts clearly without worrying about setup.
